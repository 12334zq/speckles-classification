# Speckles-classification
Speckles classification for human identification

The use of speckle patterns in modern applications is on the rise in recent years. Capitalizing on this trend, we couple in this work speckle properties together with advanced machine learning techniques based on multilayered neural networks, offering a novel approach to the task of highly accurate identification within a small predefined number of classes (e.g. a ‘smart home’ setting which restricts its operations for family members only). The procedure of capturing the patterns is relatively easy, involving a laser beam and video recording of the forehead area of the subjects accounting for variational differences. Processing by neural networks extracts unique features that allow for a unique speckle ‘forehead-print’ identity measure.
